## Usage

Assuming you have [`devise`](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) (>= 2.1) and the
[`devise-encryptable`](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise-encryptable) plugin
set up in your application, add the gem to your `Gemfile` and `bundle`

    gem 'devise-scrypt'

Then open up your Devise configuration, which supposedly lives at
`config/initializers/devise.rb` and configure your encryptor to be `scrypt`:

    # config/initializers/devise.rb
    Devise.setup do |config|
      # ..
      config.encryptor = :scrypt
      # ...
    end

It is also recommended to uncomment (or add) `config.pepper` with a random
string that will be used in addition to the per-user `password_salt` when hashing.

## Configuring algorithm complexity

The `config.stretches` option does not affect the calculation complexity. Instead,
please adjust the `scrypt` defaults to your liking. Please note that in the test
environment you will probably want to reduce complexity if you find your test suite
slows down significantly. Please refer to the [SCrypt](https://github.com/pbhogan/scrypt)
gem documentation about SCrypt config options and their effect.

    # Example config:
    SCrypt::Engine::DEFAULTS[:key_len] = 64
    SCrypt::Engine::DEFAULTS[:salt_size] = 32
